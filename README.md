Fragment was an experiment to write a small program that could fit on a diskette. I was inspired after watching many incredible demos from the demo scene. All of the ones I witnessed are leaps and bounds more sophisticated and impressive than mine but I think it was a good first try. I got a great start from this post https://nullprogram.com/blog/2016/01/31/ and for the collision detection this white paper was invaluable http://www.peroxide.dk/papers/collision/collision.pdf. I wrote some tools to aid in the compression of models, textures and audio files. They live elsewhere in github and you can find them on my repository listing. All of the wonderful art you see was created by Olivia and you can find her here https://twitter.com/oliviahns.

## The diskette

I had some nice diskette stickers printed from https://onlinelabels.com that arrived quite quickly and fit great. Fun final touch to make the diskettes looks even cooler!

## Tools to compile

Download mingw from https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/#mingw-builds to get the tools to compile.
